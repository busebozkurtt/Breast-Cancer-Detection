# Breast Cancer Detection
>Use machine learning to find out if the cancer cell is benign or malignant.

The breast cancer detection project decides whether breast cancer cells are benign or malignant. In the project, all steps from data collection to model creation were carried out. The best parameters for the data set are found by comparing the accuracy scores as a result of the KNN algorithm during model evaluation. In addition, PCA and NCA techniques were used to decrease the correlated between features and increase the accuracy score.
